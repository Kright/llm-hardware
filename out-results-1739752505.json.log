Motherboard: The motherboard should support multi-GPU configurations, ideally with at least 4 PCIe x16 slots to accommodate two RTX 5090 GPUs and provide ample power for the entire system. Look for a motherboard that supports multiple GPU setups, such as Supermicro H12 SSD/HBA or Asus Pro WS X299 SAGE/10G.\n\n3. Memory: Aim for at least 256GB of DDR4 memory (RAM). You may want to consider using error-correcting code (ECC) RAM for better stability and reliability when running intensive tasks like LLM inference.\n\n4. Storage: Choose an SSD with a high sequential read/write speed, such as the Samsung 970 EVO Plus or WD Black SN850, to help with quick data access during inference. You may also want to consider using two or more drives in RAID 0 for increased performance and redundancy.\n\n5. Power Supply: An 850W or higher power supply is recommended to provide adequate power for the system. Look for a high-efficiency, Gold/Platinum/Titanium rated PSU to minimize power consumption and heat generation.\n\n6. Cooling: Given the amount of power being used by two RTX 5090 GPUs, ensure that your cooling solution can handle the heat generated. This may include water cooling or high-quality air cooling with multiple fans.\n\n7. Network Interface: For fast data transfer between your inference rig and other devices, consider using a 10GbE or faster network interface card (NIC).\n\n8. Chassis/Case: Choose a chassis that can accommodate the large size of the RTX 5090 GPUs and support multiple PCIe x16 slots for your GPU configuration.

Verify disk existence: Double-check that the disk file you're trying to access actually exists at the specified location (`/dev/disk5` in your case).

However, there are a few steps you can take to enhance the security of your system:\n\n1. **Sandboxing:** Use OS-level sandboxing features like SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) or AppArmor for isolating applications from accessing sensitive data or other system resources without permission. These tools limit the actions that an application can perform by restricting its access to certain files, directories, and network resources.\n2. **Virtualization:** Use virtual machines like VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop or VirtualBox to isolate applications from your main operating system. By running these apps in separate virtual environments, you can limit their ability to interact with the host system and access files that are not within their designated sandbox.\n3. **Containerization:** Use containerization tools like Docker or Kubernetes to create isolated environments for your applications. Containers allow you to run multiple services on a single machine while keeping them separate from each other, thus reducing the risk of data leakage between applications.\n4. **User Accounts:** Create separate user accounts with limited permissions for running sensitive applications. By isolating these apps in their own user accounts, you can limit their ability to access files and resources that are not owned by the account.\n5. **Full-Disk Encryption:** Use full-disk encryption tools like FileVault to protect your data from unauthorized access even if an attacker manages to compromise one of your applications.\n6. **Firewall:** Enable a firewall on your Mac and configure it to block incoming connections for any application that you deem sensitive or risky. This will prevent these applications from receiving unwanted network traffic that could lead to data leakage or other security issues.\n7. **App Store:** Download apps only from trusted sources like the official App Store, which are less likely to contain malware and have been vetted by Apple for security and privacy concerns.\n8. **Update Regularly:** Keep your operating system, applications, and security software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited by attackers.\n\nWhile these steps can help improve the security of your Mac, they may not be foolproof in preventing all types of attacks.

Each character corresponds to a specific key on the matrix.\n4. `debounce()` function - Debounces the input by waiting for a specified amount of time and re-reading the column value to confirm it's stable.\n5. The `main()` function:\n   * Configures PC0-PC4 as outputs (rows) and PB6, PB7, PD5, PD6 as inputs (columns).\n   * Iterates through each row, setting one row HIGH while others are LOW to detect which key (column) has been pressed.\n   * Debounces the input by waiting for a specified amount of time and re-reading the column value to confirm it's stable.\n   * Calculates the key index in the BOARD string based on the row and column positions.\n   * Toggles an LED (`PORTB ^= (1 << PB5);`) as a test for processing the key press.\n\nThis code is designed to work with an AVR microcontroller, such as the Arduino Uno or similar boards that use the AVR architecture.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Use a temporary table instead of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**\nWhile CTEs are convenient, they can consume more memory than temporary tables, especially when working with large data sets. Instead of using CTEs, you could create temporary tables and use them as needed. This can help reduce the overall memory usage for your query.\n\n2. **Reduce the number of JOIN operations:**\nYour query has three LEFT JOIN operations that might consume a significant amount of memory if there are many rows in the `domains` table. You could consider merging some of these joins into one or reducing the number of JOINs to save memory.\n\n3. **Use LIMIT clauses wisely:**\nThe LIMIT clause helps you control the number of results returned by your query. By using LIMIT, you can reduce the amount of data processed and stored in memory during the execution of your query. In this case, you could experiment with different LIMIT values to see if they help improve performance while reducing memory usage.\n\n4. **Denormalize your data:**\nDenormalization can sometimes lead to more efficient queries by reducing the need for JOIN operations or other complex processing. If it's feasible, you might consider denormalizing your `domains` table to include the tld information directly in the table instead of storing it separately in a different table.\n\n5. **Use indexes:**\nIndexing can help improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly find and retrieve relevant data. Make sure your tables have appropriate indexes on the columns used in this query, such as `name`, `tld`, and `count`.\n\n6. **Switch to a memory-optimized table:**\nIf you are using a relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports memory-optimized tables, consider creating your `domains` table as a memory-optimized table. This can help improve query performance by storing the data directly in memory instead of on disk.\n\n7. **Partition your data:**\nIf you have a large amount of data in your `domains` table, consider partitioning it based on the `tld` column. This can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned during the execution of this query, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.", "images": null, "tool_calls": null}}, "elapsed_time": 6.8538079261779785}
